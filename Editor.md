# The c4 editor

The c4 editor is somewhat similar to a stripped-down version of VI. <br/>
Enable the editor using `#define EDITOR` (in c4.h) <br/>
The current block being edited is in 'block@'. <br/>
Use '23 edit' to edit block #23. <br/>
Use 'ed' to re-edit the last edited block. </br>
While in the editor, use ':!5 block!' to switch to another block. <br/>
